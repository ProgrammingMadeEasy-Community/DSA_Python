# Queue
* A Queue is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes an element from the queue
* First in, first out data structure (FIFO): the oldest added object is the first to be removed
* Time Complexity:
	* Access: O(n)
	* Search: O(n)
	* Insert: O(1)
	* Remove: O(1)
