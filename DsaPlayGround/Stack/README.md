# Stack
* A Stack is a collection of elements, with two principle operations: push, which adds to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element
* Last in, first out data structure (LIFO): the most recently added object is the first to be removed
* Time Complexity:
	* Access: O(n)
	* Search: O(n)
	* Insert: O(1)
	* Remove: O(1)
